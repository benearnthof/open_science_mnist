# open_science_mnist
Code for the winter 2022/2023 seminar Open Science in Statistics &amp; Machine Learning LMU Munich  

## The Goals of this project are as follows:  

* Build an image classification neural network for MNIST using PyTorch  
* Experiment with an image augmentation where we first flip the images horizontally and then rotate them by 90 degrees; with each augmentation happening with a probability of 50%  
* Manage dependencies with pipenv & prepare a two versions of the code with at least one outdated functionality  
* Provide a Github repo that can be cloned to reproduce the code  

Analysis should be provided as a Jupyter Notebook that must be executable in Google Colab  

The goal is not a good classification performance, but experiment sharing.  
The code should be able to be executed with:  
* Minimal Effort
* Without any information beyond this simple readme
* With the exact same result achieved here
